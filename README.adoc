_"Automatically open a PR on your GitOps repository when a third party service publishes an update"_

Updatecli is a tool used to apply file update strategies. Designed to be used from everywhere, each application "run" detects if a value needs to be updated using a custom strategy then apply changes according to the strategy.

You describe your update strategy in a file then you run updatecli to it.

Updatecli reads a yaml or a go template configuration file, then works into three stages

1. Sources: Based on a rule, updatecli fetches a value that will be injected in later stages such as latest application version.
2. Conditions: Ensure that conditions are met based on the value retrieved during the source stage.
3. Targets: Update and publish the target files based on a value retrieved from the source stage.

== Feature

* *Flexibility*: Easy to define tailored update strategies, you are just one yaml file from it.
* *Portability*: Easy to add to your workflow whatever it is. Just one command to run.  Of course, it's easy to remove.
* *Extensibility*: Easy to add new go packages to support more workflows.

== Why

There are already many projects out there to continuously update your files, but they all have an opinionated way of doing it and they often want you to adopt a new platform.
Building and distributing software is a difficult task and good practices constantly evolve.
Updatecli was built to work independently of the underlying dependencies to update, wherever you need it and combining whatever workflow you are using, as you can see in the following section.

== Demo

**The Quick-start is available on link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/quick-start/[www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/quick-start]**

== Installation

Updatecli is a Go binary available for Linux, MacOS and Windows from the link:https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/releases[release page] or installed via link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/installation/[other methods].

**Verify File Checksum Signature**

Instead of signing all release assets, Updatecli signs the checksums file containing the different release assets checksum.
You can download/copy the three files 'checksums.txt.pem', 'checksums.txt.sig', 'checksums.txt' from the latest https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/releases/latest[release].
Once you have the three files locally, you can execute the following command

```
COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-blob --cert checksums.txt.pem --signature checksums.txt.sig checksums.txt
```
A successful output looks like 

```
tlog entry verified with uuid: 73f57e4c16b830ccb615e00814a3481a33365bf48f9bba1c1588886b3344d0ec index: 9085154
Verified OK
```

Now you can verify the assets checksum integrity.

**Verify File Checksum Integrity**

Before verifying the file integrity, you should first verify the checksum file signature.
Once you've download both the checksums.txt and your binary, you can verify the integrity of your file by running:
```
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
```

**Verify Container signature**

```
docker pull updatecli/updatecli:vx.y.z
cosign verify updatecli/updatecli@sha256:<image_digest> 
```
== Documentation

The documentation of Updatecli is available at link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/introduction/[www.updatecli.io], but you can also look at the `examples` section to get an overview.

=== Example

This example is copy of the quickstart. You can also find it on link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/quick-start/[www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/quick-start]

We define an update strategy in "updatecli.yaml" then we run `updatecli apply --config updatecli.yaml`.
Our objective is to know if the Jenkins project published a new stable version, if they build an appropriated docker image specifically for jdk11 and automatically update our infrastructure accordingly.

|What it says:

. Sources: +
What's the latest jenkins weekly version? +
=> 2.335 +

. Conditions: +
Is there a docker image "jenkins/jenkins" from Dockerhub with the tag "2.335" +
=> Yes then proceed otherwise abort +

. Targets: +
Do we have to update the key "jenkins.controller.imageTag" from file "./charts/jenkins/values.yaml" located on the Github repository olblak/charts to "2.335"? +
=> If yes then execute the action `default` opening a GitHub pull request to the "main" branch
