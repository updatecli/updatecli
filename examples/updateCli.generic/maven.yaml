###
# This strategy will:
#
# Source:
# =======
#
#   Retrieve the version from a Maven source for the artifactID "jenkins-war" from the group "org.jenkins-ci.org"
#   in the repository "releases" located on "repo.jenkins-ci.org"
#     => 2.264
#   Append "jdk11" to it
#     => 2.264-jdk11
#
# Conditions:
# ===========
#
#   Then it will test two conditions.
#   1 - Test a dockerImage condition, "Do we have a docker image published on Dockerhub"
#       for the "jenkins/jenkins" using the tag "2.264-jdk11"
#         => Yes, proceed, No then abort
#   2 - Test a yaml condition, "Do we have a docker image set?" 
#       Test if the key jenkins.master.image is set to the value "jenkins/jenkins" 
#       from the file "charts/jenkins/values.yaml" located on the git repository 
#       "tgit@github.com:olblak/charts.git"
#         => Yes, proceed, No then abort
#
#  Targets:
#  ========
#
#  If conditions are all met, then updatecli will update (if needed) the key
#  "jenkins.master.imageTag" to "2.264-jdk11" for the file "charts/jenkins/values.yaml"
#  from the git repository "git@github.com:olblak/charts.git" then commit the change to the 
#  branch master
